# Advent of Code

Not much to say, [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is fun and everyone should try it out.  This is where I'm tracking/maintaining all of my attempts/solutions.

AoC typically has at least a handful of problems that get pretty deeply involved math-wise, so I typically will try those problems but often stick to just the problems I can more "easily" finish, because spending more than a couple hours max is no longer fun for me.

## Languages

I may never attempt too many different languages but I can least list the ones I am trying/have tried so far.

- 2022 - Mostly Python with 1 or 2 tried in C#
- 2023 - All C#
- 2024 - All C#
